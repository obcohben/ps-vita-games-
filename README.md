now you can go back to your pc then open file explore then go to this pc and the ps vita should show up as a extranel hard drive. 
<br>
all you need to do now is to drag and drop the game you just downloaded onto your vita. 
<br>

<br>
once you have done that you need to press the triagle button in vita shell and press refresh live area. once you have done that you can go back to the home screen on your vita and your new game you just downloaded should be on your home screen and ready to go.
